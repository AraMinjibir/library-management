Library Management System â€“ Project Summary
This Java-based Library Management System is a console application that allows librarians to manage books and users efficiently. It supports adding books and users, issuing and returning books, and displaying lists of all books and registered users. The system tracks whether a book is issued and automatically sets the issue and due dates. It uses core Java concepts such as classes, objects, collections (HashMap), and LocalDate for managing library operations.

Key functionalities include:

Add/search books and users

Issue/return books with due date tracking

Display book availability and user borrowing records

It is a beginner-to-intermediate level project, useful for learning object-oriented programming, data structures, and basic date handling in Java.
